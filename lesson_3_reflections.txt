When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working on a team based project, using GitHub is a great way to share.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't always have internet access so it would be inconvenient to force it and get connection errors.
