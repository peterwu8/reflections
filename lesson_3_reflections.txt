When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working on a team based project, using GitHub is a great way to share.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't always have internet access so it would be inconvenient to force it and get connection errors.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is tied to the original repository so you can view the log history.
A clone is a simple copy of the original repository so you don't have the log history.
A branch is just an alias to a commit ID.

You use a fork if you want to eventually submit a pull request.
You use a clone if you want to make a copy. You branch to experiment on something without affecting the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It helps set the user's expectations before s/he commits a change, especially if the user runs 'git status'.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be harder since I would not be able to easily point out what I changed.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you want to implement an idea that is diverges from the master, then branching makes sense.
In the earlier phase of the "master" project, it's ok to work directly on the master.
